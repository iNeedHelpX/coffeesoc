You must have the flutter sdk installed if you are testing this from source.Flutter allows you to write code once and deploy to multiple devices, it is hardware Agnostic. More about flutter here: <https://flutter.dev/>

 This app runs firebase for datastorage and login. I've managed to map the user's cart to login, which means cart items are personal to each user. Admittedly this was a very difficult task to figure out. I decided to leave the shopping cart out until a later date.

I am going to add some element of blockchain to this soon, maybe to track points etc.

# A few notes about the files

I am teaching myself GetX and was trying to experiment with various solutions....

## As for my personal setup

* I run on a mac M1, iPhone XS Max and xcode simulator.

* VSCode is my IDE of choice.

* I don't own an android and have not tested my project on Android simulator. However this project is Android compatible. I have set it up to work on Android with my signing keys just in case. If needed I will send an APK file over!
